Welcome! to our Hackathon Challenge provided by QPoland Global Quantum Hackathon

> Problem Background
Solving a linear system that grows in size becomes more difficult
In reference to Carlos Bravo-Prietos' Variational Quantum Linear Algorithm Solver


> Challenge Objectives 
The overall challenge is to reproduce the implementation of the quantum algorithm from Carlos Bravo-Prieto by solving the equation below and 

1. correct cost function and quantum ansätze 
2. single execution of the quantum algorithm, using the state-vector simulator
3. quantum program’s CX-gate count
